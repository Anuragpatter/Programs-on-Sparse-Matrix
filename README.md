<b>What is a matrix?</b>

A matrix can be defined as a two-dimensional array having 'm' rows and 'n' columns. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called m Ã— n matrix. It is a set of numbers that are arranged in the horizontal or vertical lines of entries.

<b>What is a sparse matrix?</b>

Sparse matrices are those matrices that have the majority of their elements equal to zero. In other words, the sparse matrix can be defined as the matrix that has a greater number of zero elements than the non-zero elements.

<b>Why is a sparse matrix required if we can use the simple matrix to store elements?</b>

There are the following benefits of using the sparse matrix -

<b>Storage:</b> We know that a sparse matrix contains lesser non-zero elements than zero, so less memory can be used to store elements. 
         It evaluates only the non-zero elements.

<b>Computing time:</b> In the case of searching in sparse matrix, we need to traverse only the non-zero elements rather than traversing all the sparse matrix elements. 
                It saves computing time by logically designing a data structure traversing non-zero elements.
